# github-openapi-types

> Generated TypeScript definitions based on GitHub's OpenAPI spec

This repository converts [GitHub's OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description/) into TypeScript definitions. It's currently an experiment. If successful, I'll move the repository to the [@octokit](github.com/octokit/) organization and continously publish the package as `@octokit/openapi-types`.
